# Election

Using information about candidates for governor from 1945 to 2012, we seek to find the relationship between death age of Preceptor and whether or not he wins the mayoral election in Newton, Massachusetts. Modern medicine has increased the overall lifespan of all candidates regardless if they won or lost. We modeled the age of death as a sum of multiple variables multiplied by their coefficients: election result, how much they won by, age during the election, political party, and sex. We are 95% confident that Preceptor will live an extra 3 to 14 years. Our estimate is 8.6 years.
